First of all we were on a Linux operating system, but it might also works easily on MAC.

- The Kafka installation folder is already on the github, you just have to clone the repository.
- For running Kafka, first, we need to start the zookeeper and then Kafka server :
- -  Run Zookeeper : in the Kafka installation folder, use the following command to start the zookeeper server 
        > $bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
